/*This algorithm creates class by class
Creates a class structure wether it is the first one or not, a List with nodes playing, for a playing node, takes its adjacency list and counts the number of 
elements from the playing ones with which this node has adjacency, (there is an Array structure created with 1s whenever a node is still playing and 0s whenever it is not)
decides which one has the largest number of adjacencies and declares a winner, finds it in the list of still playing nodes and unlinks it and links to the class where 
it now belongs, updates the array of 0s and 1s of still playing nodes to 0, then takes its adjacency list and all nodes still playing on this list are passed to AdjOfThisNode, 
the list of nodes no longer being able to participate in this class due to adjacency to some element, and the array of 0s and 1s of still playing nodes is also updated
